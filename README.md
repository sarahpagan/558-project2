# Overview

This document demonstrates how to retrieve and summarize data from the
United States National Parks Service (NPS)
[API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm). The
NPS API provides access to data about official NPS parks and their
activities, campgrounds, events, photos, and more. In this vignette, I
build functions to interact with four of the API’s endpoints. I then use
these functions to perform some exploratory data analysis.

# Requirements

To retrieve data from the NPS API you will need to sign up for a free
API key at the [Get Started with the NPS
API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm) web page.

Additional, helpful documentation about the NPS API is located
[here](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm).

To develop my API interaction functions, I used the following packages:

`httr`

`jsonlite`

`dplyr`

In addition, I used the following packages to manipulate and visualize
data:

`stringr`

`tidyr`

`ggplot2`

`sf`

# API Interaction Functions

## get_NPS_parks

This function interacts with the parks endpoint to retrieve NPS parks
located in your state. The required input is `key` and the optional
input is `states`, a character vector of two-letter state codes
(e.g. `c("NC", "MI")`).

The output is a tibble of NPS parks. If no state(s) is supplied, the
function will return parks in all states. There are numerous site
designations within NPS (other than “National Park”) and descriptions
for each designation can be found
[here](https://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/designations.htm). 3

``` r
get_NPS_parks <- function(key, states = NULL){
  if(is.null(states)){
    url <- paste0("https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/parks?api_key=",
                  key,
                  "&limit=10000")
  }
  
  else{
    url <- paste0("https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/parks?api_key=",
                  key,
                  "&stateCode=",
                  paste(states, collapse = ","),
                  "&limit=10000")
  }

query <- GET(url)
results <- fromJSON(rawToChar(query$content))$data |>
  select(fullName, parkCode, states, designation, latitude, longitude) |>
  mutate(latitude = as.numeric(latitude), longitude = as.numeric(longitude)) |>
  as_tibble()

return(results)
}
```

## get_NPS_activities

This function interacts with the activities/parks endpoint to retrieve
parks associated with your activities. The required inputs are `key` and
`activities`, a character vector of activities
(e.g. `c("Hiking", "Horse Trekking")`). The output is a tibble of NPS
parks related to the input activities.

``` r
get_NPS_activities <- function(key, activities){
  acts <- paste(activities, collapse = ",")
  acts <- sub(" ", "%20", acts)
  
  url <- paste0("https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/activities/parks?api_key=",
                key,
                "&q=",
                acts,
                "&limit=10000")
  
  query <- GET(url)
  results <- fromJSON(rawToChar(query$content))$data$parks
  
  activity <- c()
  for (i in 1:length(activities)){
    y <- rep(activities[i],
             nrow(results[[i]]))
    activity <- append(activity, y)
  }
  
  results <- results |>
    bind_rows() |>
    cbind(activity) |>
    select(fullName, parkCode, states, activity) |>
    as_tibble()
  
  return(results)
}
```

For reference, here are the categories of activities defined by NPS:

``` r
get_activities <- GET(paste0("https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/activities?api_key=",
                             my_key))
NPS_activities <- fromJSON(rawToChar(get_activities$content))$data$name
NPS_activities
```

    ##  [4] "Biking"                "Boating"               "Camping"              
    ##  [7] "Canyoneering"          "Caving"                "Climbing"

    ## [40] "Wildlife Watching"

## get_NPS_campgrounds

This function interacts with the campgrounds endpoint to retrieve data
about amenities at campgrounds in your park.

The preceding function, `get_NPS_codes`, retrieves park codes for all
parks. It can be used to look up the official code for your park and is
used in the main campgrounds function to join park names by `parkCode`.

Below, I look up the `parkCode` for each of my parks of interest –
Joshua Tree and the New River Gorge.

``` r
get_NPS_codes <- function(key) {
  url <- paste0("https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/parks?api_key=",
                key,
                "&limit=10000")
  query <- GET(url)
  results <- fromJSON(rawToChar(query$content))$data
  results |>
    select(fullName, parkCode, states) |>
    as_tibble()
}
```

``` r
library(stringr)
all_codes <- get_NPS_codes(my_key) 
my_codes <- all_codes |>
  filter(str_detect(fullName, "Joshua Tree|New River"))
my_codes
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##   fullName                                 parkCode states
    ##   <chr>                                    <chr>    <chr> 
    ## 1 Joshua Tree National Park                jotr     CA    
    ## 2 New River Gorge National Park & Preserve neri     WV

Now for the `get_NPS_campgrounds` function, the required input is `key`
and the optional input is `park_codes`, a character vector of park codes
(e.g. `c("jotr", "neri")`).

``` r
get_NPS_campgrounds <- function(key, park_codes = NULL){
  parks <- get_NPS_codes(key)
  
  if(is.null(park_codes)){
    url <- paste0("https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/campgrounds?api_key=",
                  key,
                  "&limit=10000")
  }
  
  if(!is.null(park_codes)){
    url <- paste0("https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/campgrounds?api_key=",
                  key,
                  "&parkCode=",
                  paste(park_codes, collapse = ","),
                  "&limit=10000")
  }
  
  query <- GET(url)
  camps <- fromJSON(rawToChar(query$content))$data |>
    select(name, parkCode) |>
    left_join(parks)
  results <- cbind(camps, fromJSON(rawToChar(GET(url)$content))$data$amenities)|>
    as_tibble()
  
  return(results)
}
```

## get_NPS_fees

This function interacts with the feespasses endpoint to retrieve data on
fees associated with your park. The required inputs are key an
park_codes, a character vector of park codes (e.g. `c("jotr", "neri")`).

``` r
get_NPS_fees <- function(key, park_codes){
  url <- paste0("https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/feespasses?api_key=",
                key,
                "&parkCode=",
                paste(park_codes, collapse = ","),
                "&limit=10000")
  query <- GET(url)
  results <- fromJSON(rawToChar(query$content))$data$fees |>
    bind_rows()
  
  if(length(results) > 0){
    results <- results |>
      select(entranceFeeType, cost, description) |>
      mutate(cost = as.numeric(cost))
  }
  
  else{
    stop(message = "No fees!")
  }
  
  return(results)
}
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## NPS parks in NC

First, let’s pull data on all NPS parks in North Carolina using the
`get_NPS_parks` function.

``` r
NC_parks <- get_NPS_parks(my_key, "NC")
NC_parks
```

    ## # A tibble: 12 × 6

    ## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​parkCode, ²​designation, ³​latitude,
    ## #   ⁴​longitude

### Which designation categories are represented by NC’s NPS parks?

North Carolina has twelve NPS parks in total. It turns out it’s a pretty
diverse set of parks as well, including nine unique designations.

``` r
NC_parks |>
  group_by(designation) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 2
    ##   designation             count
    ##   <chr>                   <int>
    ## 1 National Historic Site      2
    ## 2 National Historic Trail     2
    ## 3 National Seashore           2
    ## 4 National Battlefield        1
    ## 5 National Memorial           1
    ## 6 National Military Park      1
    ## 7 National Park               1
    ## 8 National Scenic Trail       1
    ## 9 Parkway                     1

### Where are NC’s NPS parks located?

The data pull from `get_NPS_parks` includes information on latitude and
longitude coordinates for each park. I use this data to plot the parks
on a map of NC below. I exclude the Trail Of Tears National Historic
Trail and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail since their recorded
geographic coordinates lie outside the state.

``` r
NC <- NC_parks |>
  filter(parkCode != "trte", parkCode != "appa")

NC_map <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"), quiet = TRUE)
ggplot(NC_map) +
  geom_sf(color = "seagreen3", fill = "honeydew", linewidth = 0.3) +
  geom_point(data = NC, mapping = aes(x = longitude,
                                      y = latitude),
             color = "grey20",
             shape = 17,
             size = 3) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = NC, aes(x = longitude,
                                          y = latitude,
                                          label = parkCode),
                           size = 5) +
  labs(title = "NPS Parks in North Carolina") +
  xlab(NULL) + ylab(NULL) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20))
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- --> \## National
NPS Statistics

Let’s use the `get_NPS_parks` function again to pull data on all NPS
parks. This time, I don’t specify a state and retrieve data on all NPS
parks in the nation.

``` r
all_parks <- get_NPS_parks(my_key)
all_parks
```

### Nationally, which NPS designation categories have the most parks?

The National Monument and National Historic Site categories have the
most NPS units, followed by National Historical Park, National Park, and
National Historic Trail. I plot counts for these top five designations
below.

``` r
all_des <- all_parks |>
  group_by(designation) |>
  filter(!designation == "") |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count))

all_des
```

    ## # A tibble: 46 × 2

    ## 10 National Seashore           10
    ## # … with 36 more rows

``` r
all_des_5 <- all_des |>
  slice(1:5)

ggplot(data = all_des_5, aes(x = reorder(designation, count))) +
         geom_col(aes(y = count), color = "seagreen1", linewidth = 1.5, fill = "seagreen4") +

  coord_flip()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- --> \### Which
states have the most National Monuments?

The National Monument designation category has the most NPS units,
therefore I break down the total count of National Monuments by state in
the summary table below. The southwest region of the country has the
highest concentration of monuments. Arizona leads the count with
thirteen monuments, and is followed by New Mexico with nine monuments.

``` r

## NPS parks with Climbing and Swimming

Next, let’s use the `get_NPS_activities` function to pull data on all
parks with “Climbing” and/or “Swimming” recorded as possible activities.

``` r
climb_swim <- get_NPS_activities(my_key, c("Climbing", "Swimming"))
climb_swim
```

    ## # A tibble: 91 × 4

    ## 10 City Of Rocks National Reserve                   ciro     ID     Climbing
    ## # … with 81 more rows

### How many parks have climbing, and how many parks have swimming?

52 NPS parks have swimming listed as a possible activity, and 39 parks
have climbing listed as a possible activity.

``` r
climb_swim |>
  group_by(activity) |>
  summarise(count = n())
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 2
    ##   activity count
    ##   <chr>    <int>
    ## 1 Climbing    39
    ## 2 Swimming    52

### Which states have the most NPS parks with climbing availability? And swimming?

Alaska is unsurprisingly dominated by climbing destinations. California
has the highest number of total parks, with an even mix of climbing and
swimming availability. Unfortunately, North Carolina has no parks with
climbing availability, but only swimming. It’s a good thing we have have
great state parks for climbing!

``` r
climb_swim_states <- climb_swim |>
  separate_rows(states, sep = ",")

ggplot(data = climb_swim_states, aes(x = states)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = activity)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey20", "turquoise3")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  xlab("state") +

### Which NPS parks have BOTH climbing and swimming recorded as possible activities?

Only nine parks have both climbing and swimming!

``` r
climb_and_swim <- climb_swim |>
  group_by(fullName) |>
  filter(n() > 1) |>
  select(-activity) |>
  distinct(fullName, states)

climb_and_swim
```

## Campground Amenities at grsm

I want to visit Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Let’s use the
`get_NPS_camgrounds` function to see how many campgrounds the park has
available.

``` r
get_NPS_codes(my_key) |>
  filter(str_detect(fullName, "Great Smoky"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   fullName                            parkCode states
    ##   <chr>                               <chr>    <chr> 
    ## 1 Great Smoky Mountains National Park grsm     NC,TN

Great Smoky Mountains National Park has 13 campgrounds recorded.

``` r
my_camps <- get_NPS_campgrounds(my_key, "grsm")
my_camps |>
  select(name)
```

    ## # A tibble: 13 × 1
    ##    name                       
    ##    <chr>                      
    ##  1 Abrams Creek Campground    
    ##  2 Balsam Mountain Campground 
    ##  3 Big Creek Campground       
    ##  4 Cades Cove Campground      
    ##  5 Cades Cove Group Campground
    ##  6 Cataloochee Campground     
    ##  7 Cosby Campground           
    ##  8 Deep Creek Campground      
    ##  9 Elkmont Campground         
    ## 10 Elkmont Group Campground   
    ## 11 Look Rock Campground       
    ## 12 Smokemont Campground       
    ## 13 Smokemont Group Campground

### Which of the Great Smoky Mountains campgrounds have the best amenities?

I choose the following amenities to investigate: cell phone reception,
potable water, bathrooms, trash/recycling collection, camp store, food
storage lockers, and firewood. I code no availability as 0, seasonal
availability as 0.5, and year round availability as 1 and create a heat
map with `geom_tile()`. Based on the results, it seems Cades Cove
Campground/Group Campground offer the most amenities at any time of
year.

``` r
my_camps_heat <- my_camps |>
  slice(1:12) |>
  select(name,
         cellPhoneReception,
         potableWater,
         toilets,
         trashRecyclingCollection,
         campStore,
         foodStorageLockers,
         firewoodForSale) |>
  mutate(potableWater = unlist(potableWater)) |>
  mutate(toilets = unlist(toilets)) |>
  pivot_longer(!name, names_to = "var", values_to = "value") |>
  mutate(value = recode(value, 
                        "No" = "0",
                        "No water" = "0",
                        "Yes - year round" = "1",
                        "Yes - seasonal" = "0.5",
                        "Flush Toilets - year round" = "1",
                        "Flush Toilets - seasonal" = "0.5")) |>
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

### On avergae, what is the cost of non-commerical, non-group entrance to NPS parks?

I use the `get_NPS_fees` function to pull data on fees for all park
codes. The function will exclude parks that don’t have any fees listed.

``` r
all_codes <- as.vector(get_NPS_codes(my_key)$parkCode)

fees <- get_NPS_fees(my_key, all_codes) |>
  select(entranceFeeType, cost) |>
  filter(entranceFeeType == "Entrance - Private Vehicle"|
           entranceFeeType == "Entrance - Motorcycle"|
           entranceFeeType == "Entrance - Per Person"
  )
```

The average entrance fee, among all parks that have fees, is highest for
private vehicles at 25.8 dollars.

``` r
fees |>
  group_by(entranceFeeType) |>
  summarise(averageCost = mean(cost), sdCost = sd(cost))
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 3
    ##   entranceFeeType            averageCost sdCost
    ##   <chr>                            <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 Entrance - Motorcycle             21.3   5.24
    ## 2 Entrance - Per Person             13.5   3.98
    ## 3 Entrance - Private Vehicle        25.8   6.15

Per person entrance is typically between 10 and 15 dollars and has the
smallest variance among the three individual entrance types, with a few
outliers at 0 and 30 dollars.

``` r
ggplot(data = fees, aes(x = entranceFeeType, y = cost)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = entranceFeeType)) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("seagreen2", "deeppink2", "turquoise2"), name = "Fee Type") +
  labs(title = "NPS Fees by Type of Entrance")
```
